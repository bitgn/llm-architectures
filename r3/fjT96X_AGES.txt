This agent is an experiment in AI-assisted coding, it was coded automatically by a coding agent.

Below is the summary of the architecture, produced by the same agent. Note how it overestimates its own accuracy.

AGES Agent Architecture (ERC3 Competition)

AGES Agent is an AI agent designed for a corporate project management, employee, and time management system. It is built on GPT-4o and employs structured output via Pydantic schemas.

Main Operational Cycle:
The agent implements an iterative ReAct cycle: Thought → Plan → Action (tool) → Result → Next Step.
The LLM returns strictly typed JSON adhering to a Pydantic schema (AgentStep → ToolCall), ensuring deterministic action routing and resilience against parsing errors. Validation occurs at the client.beta.chat.completions.parse() level, providing guaranteed parsing without regular expressions.
The schema specifies the agent's current reasoning, chosen tool, and fully typed parameters, with a maximum of 25 steps per task.

Core Components:

Parallel Executor (main_parallel.py):

* Executes up to 8 tasks simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor.
* Accelerates session processing by 5-8 times compared to sequential execution.

Agent Core (ages_agent_v2.py):

* Contains logic for the cycle, LLM invocation, tool execution, and guardrails.
* Supports standard models (GPT-4o) and Codex models via Responses API.

Tools:

* Wrappers around ERC3 API:

  * whoami, list/search/get for employees, projects, clients, and wiki.
  * log_time, update_project_status, update_employee for mutations.
  * respond for finalizing and classifying outcomes.

Prompt System (~500 lines):

* Detailed safety rules.
* Search strategies for ambiguity resolution (CV-projects, cost center codes post-M&A).
* Entity linking guidelines in responses.

Guardrails (Protective Mechanisms):

* Mandatory whoami execution before each task to establish user context.
* Guest access blocking (is_public=true) prevents access to sensitive data.
* Permissions verification ensures only Leads can change project statuses, only CEO can view salaries.
* Automatic linking of current user and mentioned employees in responses.

Error Handling and Resilience:

* Fallback strategy: On search_* errors, automatically fallback to list_* with pagination.
* Pagination limits: limit=5 for all requests to prevent API errors.
* Invalid response handling: Graceful degradation when response fields are None.
* Telemetry: Reports used tokens and completion texts to ERC3 API.

Task Completion:
Finalized via respond(message, outcome, links), providing a final response and classification:

* ok_answer: Task successfully completed.
* denied_security: Rejected for security reasons.
* none_clarification_needed: Further clarification required.
* error_internal: Internal system error.

Best result achieved: 70/100 tasks (70% accuracy) on ERC3-PROD.
