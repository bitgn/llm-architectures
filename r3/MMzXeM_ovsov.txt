I implemented a single-agent architecture where tools are mapped 1:1 to the API endpoints without modification.

I added only one custom tool, ask_wiki, which allows the agent to ask natural language questions about the wiki. The implementation of ask_wiki is straightforward: the entire wiki content is injected into the system prompt (which proves to be highly efficient due to context caching).

The agent's main system prompt is concise (**only 320 tokens**) to avoid overfitting; it contains only wiki-independent facts.
It defines a mandatory execution sequence:
1) Call who_am_i and get_employee...
2) Call ask_wiki to retrieve user permissions...
3) Validate security. If the user lacks permissions...
4) If authorized, fulfill the User task...

(plus a few more instructions).

Performance:
The deepseek-reasoner model performed the best—it offered the optimal balance of accuracy, speed, and cost.
* Cost: ~$0.60 per 100 tasks.
* Efficiency: Average cache hit/miss ratio ≈ 30.

Conclusion:
I considered applying the approaches from your sgr-agent-erc3-test sample, but ultimately settled on a simpler (and, in my view, more universal) architecture.
