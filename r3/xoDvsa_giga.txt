I used gpt-5.1 with a vanilla ReAct agent on LangGraph. I implemented all ERC functions as tools, plus a few additional tools following agent-building best practices:

> plan tool
> think tool (for controlled reasoning)
> critic tool (the critic tool uses structured output with dedicated reasoning fields).

Context is a single continuous thread: at any moment the agent can see the full chain of its own reasoning and actions. Everything else was achieved through careful prompt engineering.

I also plan to publish all source code in my Telegram channel: https://t.me/robofuture
